## Deep Reinforcement Learning by Imitation with MuJoCo and Stable Baselines 3
>>> ### DRLoco = DeepMimic ( MuJoCo, StableBaselines3 )

#### This repository...
* implements the [DeepMimic Framework](https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepMimic)
* using the [PPO algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) from the [Stable-Baselines3 repository](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io)
* to obtain (deep reinforcement) learning-based controllers
* for (walking) robots simulated with the [MuJoCo Physics Engine](https://mujoco.org/).

#### This repository is for you, when:
* you have a bipedal robot and need a controller to generate stable human-like walking
* you have a MuJoCo model of a bipedal robot and you want it to learn to walk like a human
* you have any kind of a legged robot and a set of reference trajectories (e.g. motion capturing) and you want a robust controller to let your robot imitate the reference motion
* you want to try out the DeepMimic Approach with minimal effort
* you need high quality mocap data for Imitation Learning
